// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ย้ายโต๊ะ — keeping a diner's phone pointed at their own bill
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A diner's phone is pinned to the table number printed on the QR it scanned.
// When staff move that bill to another table (or merge it into one), the phone
// would stop matching its own order — so it follows the bill instead.
//
// Two pieces of memory make that work, and they answer different questions:
//
//   seen   — the ids of bills this phone has watched at its own table. This is
//            what makes following SAFE: the next group seated at the old table
//            has never seen the previous group's bill, so they are never
//            dragged along with it.
//   follow — { from, to, billId }: the resulting redirection, stored so a
//            reload lands on the right table on the FIRST paint instead of
//            re-deriving it after the order list arrives.
//
// The decision itself is kept pure here (no React, no localStorage) so it can be
// tested directly; App.jsx only loads/saves the two records around it.
