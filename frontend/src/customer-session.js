// ปิดโต๊ะ = จบเซสชันของลูกค้า — clearing a diner's session once the bill is paid
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A diner's phone has no login: it is "in" a table's session simply by holding
// the QR link. That is fine while they are eating, but the moment staff take
// payment the bill is closed and that phone must stop being a way into the
// table — otherwise the group that just left can keep the page open (or reload
// the same link) and drop food onto a table they are no longer sitting at.
//
// So payment ends the session on the phone as well as on the board:
//
//   1. the phone notices that a bill IT watched has been settled ('paid'),
//   2. it says thank-you for THANKS_MS, then locks itself out of the menu,
//   3. every trace of the seating (follow + seen bills + cart) is cleared.
//
// The lock is remembered per SEAT (the table whose QR was scanned) and lasts
// the current SHIFT (day/night), so re-opening or re-scanning the same link
// lands back on the locked screen instead of a fresh menu — until the shop turns
// to the night side or the next working day begins, when it clears itself and
// the same phone may scan the same table again. It is deliberately device-local:
// the next group sits down with their OWN phones, which have never seen this
// record, and they scan in exactly as normal.
//
// Kept out of React (like table-follow.js) so the rules can be read and tested
// on their own; App.jsx only loads/saves the record around them.

// The QR link (…/?table=5) is what turns a phone into a customer, but leaving it
// in the address bar hands the diner a way back in: the ordering page sits in
// the browser's history and its back button, ready to be re-opened after the
// bill is settled. So the link is read once and then wiped off the URL, and the
// seat it named is kept here instead.

//     session even though the URL no longer says which table they are at;
//   * it dies with the browser tab, so a phone (or the shop's own handset) that
//     scanned once does not keep opening into the customer menu forever —
//     closing the tab makes it an ordinary visitor again.
// The lock written at เช็กบิล time is the opposite case and stays in
// localStorage: it MUST outlive the tab, or closing it would be a way around.
